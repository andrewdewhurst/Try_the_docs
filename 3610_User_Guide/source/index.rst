3610 User Guide
===========================================

The XMOS VocalFusion\ :sup:`Â®` XVF3610 User Guide is written for system
architects and engineers designing Far-field voice systems using the
XVF3610 voice processor. The document describes typical usage models,
the processor architecture, key feature operation, and interface
definitions. In conjunction with the product datasheet, these two
documents provide all the information required for system design, from
concept to production testing and verification.

It is expected that this document is read in conjunction with the
relevant datasheet and that the user is familiar with basic voice
processing terminology.

.. note::

    This issue of the user guide covers the functionality supported by
    version 5.2 of the VocalFusion XVF3610 application firmware.
